** About Following in the tracks of the ancient romans**

A walk through history More than 2000 years ago, the Puster Valley was under the administrative control of the Roman Empire. Today you can still discover evidence of the early history of the Noricum province, which was once part of the Great Celtic kingdom, in parts of Ehrenburg/Casteldare and the nearby settlement area of St. Lorenzen/San Lorenzo.An attractive and leisurely circular walk between the southern center of Kiens/Chienes and the western landscape area of Ehrenburg/Casteldarne offers insights into the history of the Romans. The importance of travelling and the role of the rest stops around Kiens/Chienes are presented in an exciting way at various rest points, with information’s about the Romans, to bring the past to life.One of the best-preserved milestones from Roman times is a two-meter-high column sculpted from quartz phyllite. The Roman stone was erected during the reign of the Roman Emperor Lucius Septinus Severus and shows the distance to the Roman town of Aguntum near Lienz in East Tyrol further to the east.Also worth seeing (only from the outside) is the historic Ehrenburg castle, which was built in 1250, and the nearby baroque parish church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. The beautiful wooden fences and the old dry-stone walls in Ehrenburg/Casteldarne are also particularly attractive. Refreshment stops to take a well-deserved break at: Bar Restaurant Obermair in Ehrenburg/Casteldarne and Riverhotel Post in Kiens/Chienes. parking space Chienes/Kiens center
