** About Vanea-Alp Relax Guesthouse**

Welcome to the brand new Vanea – Alp Relax Guesthouse. A new apartment complex with 5 flats was built in 2022 in the beautiful village of Kiens/Chienes, in South Tyrol's Pustertal Valley. We planned, drew and tweaked day and night to create the perfect holiday retreat for our guests! We focused on rest and relaxation just as much as premium living. This led us to build various highlights around the complex: an exclusive wellness area, a garden with playground, a play room and, last but not least, a roof terrace with 360° views of the impressive South Tyrolean mountains. A little bit of home and a little bit of hotel – that's how you’ll feel here!
