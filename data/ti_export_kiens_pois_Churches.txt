** About Chapel “Unsere liebe Frau im Stöckl”**

The renovated chapel hut dedicated to Our Lady of Sorrows in St. Sigmund was built in 1621 and expanded in 1644. The new construction is considered one of the most charming devotional spaces of the Baroque period. Great attention was paid to detail. The nave is covered by a dome, while the altar area is finished with a cross vault. The Stations of the Cross are copper engravings by Franz Xaver Endres from Augsburg. The miraculous image on the high altar is a Pietà set in an open landscape, flanked by Joachim and Anna, dating from the late 15th century. The ceiling paintings were created by Josef Anton Zoller. Beneath the dome, the four Evangelists are depicted, while scenes from the Book of Esther are shown in the dome itself. In the altar area, the three divine virtues—Faith, Hope, and Charity—are displayed, complemented by Courage.
